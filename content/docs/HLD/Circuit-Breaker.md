In this article, we are going to briefly discuss the circuit breaker design pattern in microservices. Let‚Äôs start with a simple example.
[

Let‚Äôs say we have a large\-scale system with several microservices. Order\-Service and Payment\-Service are two microservices among them. After the user clicks the ‚ÄúComplete Order‚Äù button, a request will be sent to the backend. In the backend, requests will go through several other services such as User\-Service, Item\-Service, etc. Finally, the request will go from Order\-Service to Payment\-Service. Then Payment\-Service will process the card details, get the payments done and the payment status will be sent to Order\-Service back.
### Problem
[

However, let‚Äôs assume that Payment Service fails to process requests for a while due to some reason such as network issues, unavailability of the service, service failure, etc. Meanwhile, the system receives 10,000 purchasing requests. What happens is, that Order\-Service sends each request to Payment\-Service using available threads and waits for a response. However, after a few seconds, these requests will be timed out. This will be a huge drawback due to ineffective network, thread, memory, and database allocation for each request. Most importantly this drawback will cascade to all other services, that are involved in this order\-processing task.
### Solution
This issue can be easily solved if we could identify, that there is some ongoing issue with Payment\-Service. Hence, Order\-Service can avoid sending new requests to Payment\-Service. Rather it can immediately send a suitable fail response, for incoming new payment processing requests.
Now let‚Äôs see how we can identify whether Payment\-Service is working or not. For this, we can use some statistical techniques along with 3 states.
* **Closed State**: In this state, the circuit is closed. This means we send requests to Payment\-Service. After receiving a success/failure response from Payment\-Service, we calculate the failure rate of the last N requests. If the failure rate > X threshold, then the state will be switched to Open\-State. Otherwise, stay in Closed\-State.
* **Open\-State**: In this state, the circuit is open. This means we do not send requests to Payment\-Service. We stay in this state for T secs and switch state to Half\-Open\-State.
* **Half\-Open\-State**: In this state, the circuit is partially closed. This means we send only a few n \(n<<N\) requests and check the failure rate. If it still fails we move back to Open\-State or go to Closed\-State.

The diagram below explains these three states.

### Implementation
Below is a sample Java code snippet for Circuit Breaker using [resilience4j] with discussed X, T, N, and n parameters.
// CODE IN ORDER\-SERVICE
// Create a custom configuration for a CircuitBreaker
CircuitBreakerConfig circuitBreakerConfig = CircuitBreakerConfig.custom\(\)
    .failureRateThreshold\(50\) // X
    .waitDurationInOpenState\(Duration.ofMillis\(1000\)\) // T
    .ringBufferSizeInClosedState\(100\) // N
    .ringBufferSizeInHalfOpenState\(10\) // n
    .build\(\);
// Build Circuit Breaker
CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker= 
  CircuitBreaker.ofDefaults\("Payment\-Service", circuitBreakerConfig\);
// Decorate Function
Supplier<String> decoratedSupplier = CircuitBreaker
        .decorateSupplier\(circuitBreaker, this::callPaymentService\);
// Make Call
Try<String> result = Try.ofSupplier\(decoratedSupplier\);
Likewise, we can use this microservice design pattern called Circuit Breaker Pattern to prevent an application from calling a service, which most likely failed.
