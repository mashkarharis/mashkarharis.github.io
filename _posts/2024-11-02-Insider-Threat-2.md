title: Did You Know About Insider Threat
description: >-
    Traditional security systems mostly focus on external threats. Due to this, there is a high chance of occurring security threats from inside of the company. These types of threats are called ‘Insider Threats’. An insider threat refers to a cyber security risk that originates from within an organization. These threats are occurring from the people who have access to sensitive information of the organization. These persons can be current employees, former employees, contractors, or business associates. They may misuse these security credentials intentionally or unintentionally.

## Anomalous Activities

### Behavioral Indicators

**_I. Regularly working off hours_**

If a person regularly works off hours without a valid reason, it can be suspicious. Because in off hours there will be only a few co-workers. Hence he/she can misuse the system without any witnesses.

**_II. Display resentment towards co-workers_**

If a worker always tries to avoid co-workers from coming near to his/her working machine by showing resentment towards them, it can be suspected that he/she misuse his/her working machine.

### Digital Indicators

**_I. Unusual login_**

By detecting unusual login attempts, the organization can suspect that someone is trying to misuse organization’s credentials to access sensitive information. Login from unusual locations, login at unusual times, changing password frequently are some of the examples to unusual logins.

**_II. Excessive volume of traffic_**

If some employee is downloading large amounts of data unusually into his/her working machine, it can be suspected that he/she is downloading some software/code that gives control of the system to an outsider.

If an employee uploads an unusual amount of data from his/her working machine, it can be suspected that he/she is sending secure information about the company to someone else.

**_III. Unusual usage patterns_**

Let’s assume that the project manager of the company accesses the financial accounting resources of the company more often without any specific reason. From this example, we can suspect that the project manager of the company steals and sells the financial information of the company to its competitor.

## Past In Real World 

*   Tesla: A malicious insider sabotaged systems and sent proprietary data to third parties.
*   Facebook: A security engineer abused his access to stalk women.
*   Coca-Cola: A malicious insider stole a hard drive full of personnel data.
*   Suntrust Bank: A malicious insider stole personal data, including account information, for 1.5 million customers to provide to a criminal organization.

## Prevent Insider Attacks

**_Protect critical assets_**

First the company needs to identify the critical assets that need high security. These assets can be networks, systems, data etc. Then the organization should identify the levels of priority needed to be given to these assets. Finally high priority assets should be given a higher level of protection than others.

**_Install Software which detects threats_**

Install software to the system which tracks the user behaviors, logs, networks etc. Today there is software that not only monitors how users move through the network, but also protects assets on a data level. This type of security software can be installed to the system for higher protection.

**_Enforce policies_**

Define an organization’s security policy in a well-descriptive manner. There should not be holes in the security policy of the organization. Hence, there will be no doubts about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. Due to this, the chance that employees can generalize mistakes becomes low and employees will work under a controlled environment.

**_Give Security Education to Employees_**

Some insider threats happen due to mistakes that are done unintentionally. To avoid this, the organization can conduct security training and awareness sessions, which educate them on security related matters.

## Other Improvements Can Be Taken

1.  Protect databases against attacks like SQL injections.
2.  Monitor the activities of privileged users.
3.  Encrypting and masking sensitive data.
4.  Monitor activity logs of the database.
5.  Use artificial intelligence to learn user behaviors.
